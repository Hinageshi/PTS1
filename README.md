![Alt text](img/website.png?raw=true "Website")

This group project was created during my first semester at the University Institute of Technology of Laval.
We needed to pick a theme (we chose Computer Viruses) and had to create a website, a poster and a Prezi about it. I was in charge of the website.

This website was created using the Bootstrap Template Grayscale.
